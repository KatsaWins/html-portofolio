<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> <h2>Hello Everyone</h2>


  I am Chris and i am an economics university graduate. After getting my Degree and finally finishing with <br/>
  my army obligations as well, i had to start searching for a job on my field. I was never really sure about<br/> my passion
  on economics but i have been always sure about my passion on creating or developing things (or destroying them<br/>
  when i was really really young if you ask my mom lol). The idea of getting a job on a field that doesn't<br/>
  interests me scared me and made me reconsider things, so i took the initiative and started web development<br/>
  courses with an ulterior purpose to finally fullfil my need for creation. If there is one thing that i have<br/>
  learned through all those 25 years of my life, is that if you love what you do you will never work a day in your life.
